## Services:

- user
- product
- order
- cart
- search & filtering

## Tech stack:

- Nodejs, Express, Typescript (Language/framework)
- MongoDB, Postgres, (DB)
- JWT/Passport.js (auth)
- Stripe, Paypal (payment)
- Search & Filtering (Search and Filtering)
- React (Front)
- Docker, Kubernetes (Containerization and Orchestration)
- ELK, Prometheus & Grafana(Logging and Monitoring)
- RabbitMQ, Kafka (Message Queues)
- AWS (Cloud)
- ?(Testing)

## Workflow:

### User Service:

Description: Manages user accounts, registration, authentication, and user profiles.
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for user data, Passport.js for authentication.
Endpoints: /register, /login, /profile, /orders

### Product Service:

Description: Handles product catalog, product details, and inventory.
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB for product data.
Endpoints: /products, /products/{product_id}

### Cart Service:

Description: Manages user shopping carts and checkout processes.
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, Redis for cart data.
Endpoints: /cart, /checkout

### Order Service:

Description: Manages order processing, order history, and payments.
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, PostgreSQL for order data, Stripe for payment processing.
Endpoints: /orders, /payments

### Search & Filtering Service:

Description: Enables users to search for products and apply filters.
Tech Stack: Node.js, Express.js, Elasticsearch for search functionality.
Endpoints: /search, /filter

### API Gateway:

Description: Routes and manages incoming requests, handles authentication, and rate limiting.
Tech Stack: Nginx, Kong, or custom API gateway solutions.
Endpoints: Routes requests to the appropriate microservices.

### Front-End Application:

Description: The user interface where customers interact with the e-commerce platform. It communicates with the microservices through the API Gateway.
Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React, Angular, Vue.js, etc.).

## What each componenet do ?

### Database:

Each microservice stores its data in its respective database (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, Redis, Elasticsearch).

### Message Queues:

You may use message queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or Apache Kafka) for asynchronous communication between microservices.

### Containerization:

Docker containers can be used for packaging and deploying microservices.

### Orchestration:

Kubernetes can manage the deployment, scaling, and monitoring of microservices.

### Authentication and Authorization:

Implement authentication and authorization mechanisms using JWT, OAuth, or other methods.

### Logging and Monitoring:

Employ tools like the ELK Stack, Prometheus, and Grafana to monitor, log, and troubleshoot the system.

### Load Balancing:

Use load balancers to distribute traffic evenly across multiple instances of microservices.
